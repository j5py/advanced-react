# Advanced React
> From Meta on Coursera

The final project requires you to complete a portfolio in React. You will be provided with code snippets, and your task is to use these, plus any of your own code to complete your developers' portfolio.

This is a creative project, and the goal is to use as many React concepts as possible within this portfolio. You can use component composition, code reusability, hooks, manage state, interact with an external API, create forms, lists and so on.

**Done**: please review the [Commits](https://github.com/j5py/advanced-react/commits/main/) following the [Instructions](https://github.com/j5py/advanced-react/blob/main/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
